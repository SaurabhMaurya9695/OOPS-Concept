OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the 
data, while object-orientedprogramming is about creating objects that contain both data and 
methods.

Java - What are Classes and Objects?

Classes -> No memory initalized ;
objects -> Memory initilized are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.


class -> fruit ...
object -> apple , banana etc;

object is an instance of a class.
When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods
from the class.

Java Classes/Objects 

Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes 
and methods

attributes means - > car has weight , and color red ;
methods means -> car has drive and break;

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects
